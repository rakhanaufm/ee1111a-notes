Coming into this module, I was pretty optimistic due to my significant physics background. 
It turns out that it was of no use, for now, maybe later at PC2020, but I learned to stop putting expectations, and learn for the sake of learning, not grades. 
I hope the notes would be useful for you as it is for me, that's all.
Thank you for your visit.
